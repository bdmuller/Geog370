    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">How the maps were made:</h2>
    <p>The maps were created using QGIS. Within QGIS, I used the globe editor as well as the indicatrix mapping tool <br>
    to modify the different map projections of the base layer.</p>
    
    <h2>Gall-Peters Projection</h2>
    <p>The Gall-Peters Map is categorized as a cylindrical projection map. This map displays the countries <br>
    in proper proportions to one another. A drawback to this map is that there is severe distortion at the poles. <br> 
    The map was presented by James Gall in 1973, and mimics an earlier map created by Arno Peters almost a century <br> 
    earlier. </p>

    <h2>Winkel Tripel Azimuthal</h2>
    <p>The Winkel-Tripel Map is categorized as a azimuthal projection map. This map is especially good for observing <br>
    climate, vegetation, and soil. This is because of the relatively small amount of distortion regarding the areas, distance <br>
    and direction of continents, countries, and islands. This map was named after its creator, Oswald Winkel in 1921 <br>
    and accepted by the National Geographic Society in 1998. </p>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <p>Known for preserving both distance and direction, the North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant map is most used for polar routes <br>
    for navigating both air and sea.  </p>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conical</h2>
    <p>Based on the archaic projection map of Ptolemy (A.D. 100), the World Equidistant Conical Map is best used for <br>
        viewing land masses extending in an East/West direction. Examples for using this type of mapping would <br>
        include mapping Russia.  </p>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <p>Created in 1772 by Johann H. Lambert, the cylindrical equal area map is mainly used for large-scale <br>
    mapping projects for the areas near the equator and wouldn’t be recommended for smaller scale “world” maps.   </p>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel 1</h2>
    <p>This map is generally not used because it distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. <br>
    This style of map can only be used on spheres as the semimajor axis would be used on ellipsoids.   </p>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <p>Otherwise known as the standard for mapping, the Mercator Map is a cylindrical projection. While any <br>
    straight line drawn on this style of map will indicate precise compass headings, it doesn’t represent the <br> 
    shortest distance between two points. This map was originally created in 1569. The variant “Web Mercator”, is <br>
    still used in most web mapping and online services.   </p>
